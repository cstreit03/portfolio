Figure out how to connect to the hidden site and find the flag!</blockquote> <blockquote>The site is at <a href="https://not-torbian.ethtrader-ai.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://not-torbian.ethtrader-ai.com/</a> </blockquote> <h4>Step 1 — Website Review</h4> <p>For this challenge, I first visited the above website and discovered a simple, single page website which claims to be unaffiliated with the North Torbia government.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/979/1*XRkvKpp-G2WDs9c9KfN1Vw.png"></figure> <p>As part of the website review, I inspected the source code which contained some simple HTML code and CSS formatting. Unfortunately, there were no hints present in the source code.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/979/1*sEbR_yCtYCKxRuDZ5UersQ.png"></figure> <h4>Step 2 — Review DNS Information</h4> <p>Sometimes it can be helpful to review the domain registration for hints using <a href="https://lookup.icann.org/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICANN Lookup</a> or <a href="https://who.is/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WHOIS Lookup</a>. In this case, because the website uses a subdomain (<strong>not-torbian</strong>.ethtrader-ai.com), the domain would actually be registered to ethtrader-ai.com which could be unrelated to the website we are investigating. Either way, the DNS registration was masked by privacy protection, so there was not much helpful information here:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/979/1*_ym5a8OPQq8fjRZ1Y4uBGA.png"></figure> <p>Next, I searched for DNS records for the domain using <a href="https://dnsdumpster.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://dnsdumpster.com</a> which did not yield any positive results aside from the website’s IP address (which was 34.86.60.228):</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/979/1*_LKcQqxAd5vW34tHDctjMQ.png"></figure> <h4>Step 3 — Review SSL Information</h4> <p>Going back to the website we were given, I noticed it uses the HTTPS protocol which means it has an SSL certificate. Next, I decided to review the certificate. You can do this in the browser natively (for Firefox, see the section titled “Viewing a certificate” in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-website-certificate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this article</a>) or by using an online tool like <a href="https://www.sslchecker.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.sslchecker.com</a>.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, the certificate is associated with a second domain name called <strong>definitelynotaflag.north.torbia</strong>:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/979/1*Sb_A1vm9XhpEJV6ossQ7ow.png"></figure> <h4>Step 4 — Review the Discovered Domain</h4> <p>The newly discovered domain (definitelynotaflag.north.torbia) is not a publicly accessible domain because it does not have a valid top-level domain (TLD) such as .com, .org, .net, etc. This means it would not be accessible simply by typing it into your browser. To confirm this, you can also attempt to visit it which fails:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/975/1*7XGJ1t2hzg8gM_jd50og4w.png"></figure> <h4>Step 5 — Accessing the Hidden Website</h4> <p>However, just because the domain isn’t publicly registered doesn’t mean it isn’t accessible by other methods. At first, I tried to access the IP of the website (34.86.60.228) directly. This presented a 404-error page indicating that there is not a page found on the server’s IP address. However, since it did not redirect me to the main website, it does mean that this web server could be hosting other websites:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/979/1*L8FArHqbnuPbcPAU5mfv8A.png"></figure> <p>Since I know that a web server is running on IP address 34.86.60.228, and I have a domain name from earlier called definitelynotaflag.north.torbia, I decided to add a DNS entry to my Kali Linux system’s hosts file.</p> <p>On Linux operating systems, you can do so by running the command <strong>sudo nano /etc/hosts</strong> in a terminal window. I added the line shown in the screenshot below to my hosts file and saved it:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/975/1*4zs8964Ql1M5HmFWzOQOKw.png"></figure> <h4>Step 6 — Attempt to Access the Hidden Website</h4> <p>With the DNS entry saved in our /etc/hosts file, it is time to test whether we can access the hidden website. Navigating to definitelynotaflag.north.torbia in my browser displayed this hidden website:</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/975/1*kBZqF3dLOLDX3gTSBBdRjA.png"></figure> <p>Scrolling a little further down on the website revealed the flag for this challenge: C1(vH0st_S4n_M4g1c_R3ve4l3d}</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/975/1*RflE7YNYSL-urMLJUbJPfw.png"></figure> <p>Once done with the challenge, it’s important to remove the added entry from the host file located at /etc/hosts for hygienic purposes.</p> <p>Hopefully this write-up was helpful and provided some insight into how to investigate websites!
